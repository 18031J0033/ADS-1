Give tilde approximations for the following quantities:

1.N + 1
The tilde approximations is N
2.1 + 1/N
The tilde approximations is 1
3.(1 + 1/N )(1 + 2/N )
The tilde approximations is 1
4.2N^3 - 15 N^2 + N
The tilde approximations is 2N^3
5.lg(2N )/lg N
The tilde approximations is log(2N)
6.lg(N^2 + 1) / lg N
The tilde approximations is log(N^2+1)
